# JVM,JRE,JVM:
 * We need java virtual machine to run our code and get byte code for the java code.
 * To run this file we need some extra files or library which we will get with the help of JRE i.e. java runtime environment.
 * JDK is basically the combination of both java virtual machine and java runtime environment.


 *** 
 ## JVM ---> +  JRE ----> (make) JDK
